REST : Representational State Transfer 
SOAP : single object Access protocol 

REST started in 1999

Principle 1 Everything is a resource {Images,videos , text etc}
Principle 2 Each source is identified by unique identifier {jpeg , png etc }
Principle 3 Manipulation of different resouces is standard {Get , Post , Delete , Trace etc }
Principle 4 Resource can have multiple representation
Principle 5 communicate with the resource in a stateless manner

Statelessness of restful api isolates the caller from the changes in the server side 
the caller is not expected to communicate with the same server everytime 

Developers reject simple solutions and turn complex ones into more complex 

When it comes to data transfer it should not be a complex solution
